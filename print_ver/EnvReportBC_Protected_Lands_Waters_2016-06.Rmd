Protected lands and waters are legally established areas set aside to conserve nature and cultural values. Canada adopted the [UN Convention on Biological Diversity targets](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/) to protect at least 17% of terrestrial areas and inland water and 10% of coastal and marine areas by 2020, which has been extended until 2023 [(Pathway to Canada Target 1)](https://www.conservation2020canada.ca/home). B.C.'s
network of protected areas contribute to the Canadian and global targets. This indicator details the amount, the type, and the location of protected areas across B.C.

There are different types of conserved areas in B.C. that contribute to Canada's Target 1 progress [(Pathway to Canada Target 1)](https://www.conservation2020canada.ca/home). B.C.'s contributions include parks and protected areas (PPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). PPAs are areas typically designated through through legal or other effective means for long-term conservation. Examples of PPAs include National and B.C. Parks, Indigenous-led land-use planning areas, Wildlife Refuges, Natural Areas, Habitat Protection Areas, and Ecological & Biodiversity Reserves. OECMs are conserved areas other than PPAs that similarly seek long-term conservation of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and applicable cultural, spiritual, socio-economic, and other relevant values. Examples of OECMs include privately owned conservation lands, traditional land use planning areas, areas protected through Indigenous land claim agreements, among others [(Accounting for protected and conserved areas 2019)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e007452e69cf9a7af0a033/t/60806e9b70e77d3268e87bf1/1619029667230/Communication+Document+-+Visual_EN%281%29.pdf).

### Map of Protected Areas Across B.C. (2020)

-   **As of 2020, protected lands and water cover `r land_total`% of
    B.C.'s terrestrial areas and inland water and `r water total`% of
    coastal and marine areas.**
-   For terrestrial areas/inland water, the protected areas are
    comprised of `r land_ppa$summary_total`% PPAs and
    `r land_oecm$summary_total`% OECMs.
-   Coastal areas in B.C. are comprised of `r water_ppa$summary_total`%
    PPAs and `r water_oecm$summary_total`% OECMs.
-   The amount of protected land and water varies across B.C. The
    distribution is shown below by two different ecosystem classification systems below.

### Trends in the Protection of British Columbia's Terrestrial and Marine Ecoregions (1886-2020)

* To help visualize where protected areas are located in B.C., two different ecosystemB.C. is divided into ecoregions to  The map below shows the percent protected of B.C.'s 43 [ecoregions](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/plants-animals-and-ecosystems/ecosystems/broad-ecosystem/an_introduction_to_the_ecoregions_of_british_columbia.pdf). Ecoregions are considered 'big picture' ecosystems and group nearby areas with similar climate and geologic features together. There are 39 terrestrial and 4 marine ecoregions in B.C. 
* The most protected ecoregions include

### Terrestrial Ecosystem Representation within Protected Lands in B.C.

The distribution of protected areas is also shown by [biogeoclimatic
    zones (BEC)](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/becweb/). 
* BEC zones are defined by the biological communities that can develop in an area due to the climate and geography. They provide insight into the soils and plant communities you would expect to see in an area. 
-   Ecosystems in British Columbia are characterized as  - geographic areas
    with similar patterns of energy flow, vegetation and soils.
-   Protected lands are not evenly distributed among British Columbia's
    ecosystems. High elevation and mountainous areas such as the Spruce
    -- Willow -- Birch, Boreal Altai Fescue Alpine, and Interior
    Mountain-heather Alpine zones have more than the provincial average
    protected. Low elevation, warm, valley bottom areas tend to be
    underrepresented in the protected areas system --- for example,
    Coastal Douglas-fir, Ponderosa Pine, and Interior Douglas-fir zones.
-   There is also high spatial variation in the proportion of ecosystem
    protection across the province. For example, most of the 20% Coastal
    Western Hemlock zone that is protected occurs along the west coast
    of Haida Gwaii. Protected areas in the Spruce -- Willow -- Birch
    zone are more evenly distributed.

### Details of Protected Land & Water Designations in B.C.

-   **BC Parks (14.4% terrestrial; 0.9% marine)**

    -   Most of the protected land and a third of the protected waters
        in B.C. are managed by [BC
        Parks](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/).
    -   Protected areas managed by BC Parks are governed by several
        pieces of
        [legislation](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/aboutBCParks/legis.html)
        and fall into one of the following designations: Ecological
        Reserve, Provincial Park, Protected Area, Conservancy,
        Recreation Area.

-   **National Protected Areas (0.7% terrestrial; 2.2% marine)**

    -   The Government of Canada has established protected land and
        marine areas in British Columbia, for example National Parks,
        National Wildlife Areas, Marine Protected Areas and Migratory
        Bird Sanctuaries.
    -   These designations are governed by several pieces of federal
        legislation including: [*Canada National Parks Act*, *Canada
        National Marine Conservation Areas
        Act*](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/agen/dp-pd/lr-ar/lr-ar1.aspx),
        [*Canada Wildlife Act*, *Migratory Birds Convention
        Act*](http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=E826924C-1), and
        the [*Oceans Act
        (1996)*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-2.4/).

-   **B.C. Provincial Administered Conservation Lands (0.26%
    terrestrial; 0.07% marine)**

    -   [Administered Conservation
        Lands](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/habitat/conservation-lands/)
        are lands over which the Government of British Columbia has
        legal administrative and management authority.
    -   Wildlife Management Areas are Administered Conservation Lands
        that are designated under the provincial [*Wildlife
        Act*](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/) to protect habitat
        for regionally, nationally or internationally significant
        species.
    -   Other types of Administered Conservation Lands are aquired by
        way of: [*Land
        Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96245_01)
        section 106 Transfers of Administration, Fee Simple Acquisitions
        (through direct purchase, donation, or land exchange), and Lease
        Sites.

-   **B.C. Non-Government Organization Conservation Areas (0.1%
    terrestrial)**

    -   [B.C. Non-Government Organization Conservation
        Areas](http://ltabc.ca/resources/2012-02-05-22-20-02), also
        known as private conservation lands, include Fee Simple areas,
        defined as ownership of the title to a legal parcel, and
        Registerable Interests --- other conservation securements
        registered on title, such as conservation covenants and leases.

**Note:** The sum of the numbers listed above will be greater than the
total provincial area reported on this page (15.4%). This is because
there is some overlap among designations. For example, there are about
10,000 hectares of land that are owned by non-governmental conservation
organizations, but are administered by the province. These lands are
included in both categories, but the overlap is removed in the overall
provincial and ecoregional analyses.

### Methods

This indicator uses data from 3 sources: the 2015 [Canadian Council on
Ecological Areas (CCEA) shapefile database of protected areas in
Canada](http://www.ccea.org/) accessed in January 2016; the provincially
administered conservation lands maintained by the [B.C. Ministry of
Forests, Lands and Natural Resource
Operations](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/habitat/conservation-lands/),
and data for privately held conservation lands, such as those owned by
land trusts, or private lands protected by conservation covenants,
available from the [British Columbia Non-Governmental Organization
Conservation Areas Database Working
Group](http://ltabc.ca/resources/2012-02-05-22-20-02). Municipal and
regional parks are not included in the analyses. The
[**R**](http://www.r-project.org) code for repeating the analyses
presented on this page is [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/protected_areas_analysis). Overlaps
between protected areas have been accounted for in the analyses.
